# FM_yield_curve


Interest rate financial instruments (cash flow, bank bill, bond, portfolio): simulation of the market.

Bootstrap derives the rate from coupon to zero for same time period.

The instruments will move around (rates will change) in your simulation.
I suggest using geometric browning motion to create the movement.
You will create a visualisation of the yield curve moving around as the underlying instruments move around.
