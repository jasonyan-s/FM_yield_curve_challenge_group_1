    "# Zero Curve Construction and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the construction and manipulation of zero curves, which are fundamental tools in fixed income mathematics and financial engineering. The notebook covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implementation of exponential interpolation for yield curves\n",
    "2. Working with the ZeroCurve class to:\n",
    "   - Add zero rates to the curve\n",
    "   - Calculate discount factors\n",
    "   - Perform interpolation for missing maturities\n",
    "   - Transform curve data for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Zero Rates**: Interest rates for zero-coupon bonds of different maturities\n",
    "- **Discount Factors**: Present values of 1 unit of currency paid at future dates\n",
    "- **Exponential Interpolation**: A method for estimating rates between known points on the curve\n",
    "- **Amount at Maturity (AtMat)**: Future value based on zero rates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "The notebook uses standard Python libraries for mathematical operations and data manipulation:\n",
    "- math: For basic mathematical operations\n",
    "- numpy: For numerical computations\n",
    "- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis\n",
    "- Custom yield_curve module: Contains ZeroCurve class implementation"
